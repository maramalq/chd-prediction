# chd-prediction
 
The study aims to predict whether a person has CHD or Not based on a set of health conditions and parameters related to them. Therefore, this project will follow the process illustrated below. More specifically, we will look at the topics listed below. To work through these topics, we will use Python, a high-level, general-purpose, and very popular programming language. Python programming language is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, and all cutting-edge technology in the Software Industry. For the purpose of this project, we will use libraries such as Pandas, NumPy Matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis and Scikit-Learn for machine learning and modeling tasks.
